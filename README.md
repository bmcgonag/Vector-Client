# Wireguard UI Client
A client UI for Wireguard on Linux (may work on Mac and Windows as well)

I made this because, while it's great to be proficient on the shell terminal, it's just nice to have a GUI app sometimes. Something that simply grabs your attention and says, "Hey, I'm here, and connected!."  Sometimes, maybe it says, "Hey, ummmm, I'm not connected...but it's easy to connect me if you want."

Anyway, I just want linux to be a first class citizen along with the rest of the Operating Systems in the world.  

I 100% appreciate what Wireguard is doing for VPNs and encryption, so please don't misunderstand.  I just wanted to do something to help out. 

## Me
I'm not a programmer by trade.  I'm a hobbyist (on my best day), so take this for what it is.  If you have issues, please let me know, and I'll see what I can do to fix it. 

I'm always happy to have help, and pull requests are more than encouraged. 

## The Project
I hope this will make it easy for you to use Wireguard from the client perspective. 

NeutralinoJS is a nice little project, and they are working on it, so hopefully running this from the desktop won't be such a pain in the future.

I'm making a script that will help pull the zipped up version of this repo, and get the files where they need to be.  Additionally, I will try to add something that creates a launcher for you. 

## What's in this repo?
- 2 Binaries
-- Windows (not something I've tested or messed with)
-- Linux
- Files to create the UI and give it functionality.
-- inside the app/assets folder is a config.js that you need to modify.
- wgvpn.sh
-- a shell script that can be used in a launcher to create a desktop icon to launch the app.
